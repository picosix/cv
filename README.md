> Read more, write better

My name is Tuan. I'm a developer. I'm a blogger too.

Why I want to be a developer? Because I'm lazy. I want to make every boring task to be automatic by programming.

Why I want to be a blogger? Because I want to self-assertion. Write my experience down, help me and everyone want to learning don't repreat my mistakes.
