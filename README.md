## Curriculum Vitae

My name is Tuan. I'm a developer. I'm a blogger, too.

Why do I want to be a developer? Because I'm lazy. I want to make every boring task automatic by programming.

Why do I want to be a blogger? Because I want to be self-assertion. Write my experience down, help me and everyone wanting to learning not to repreat my mistakes.
