## Curriculum Vitae

My name is Tuan. I'm a developer. I'm a blogger, too.

Why do I want to be a developer? Doing everything manually is kind of boring, so I figured out what if I can automate them. That's the reason why I became a developer.

Why do I want to be a blogger? Because I want to be self-assertion. Write my experience down, help me and everyone wanting to learning not to repreat my mistakes.

### Mindset

Before doing anything, I'm always think about how user interact with my application. How does my application solve their problem, make their job more interesting and make they feel comfortable. In short, **think for user** is the key of successful.

### Highlight

- 2+ experience on position `Full stack developer`
- Backend - NodeJS
- Frontend- ReactJS
- GraphQL
- Docker ([Personal hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/picosix/) with NodeJS, Nginx images)
- Create clean code or make code to be clean
- Write unit test (TDD)

### Experience

#### Isentia (March 2018 - Now)

**Position:** Fullstack Developer, DevOps

**Responsibility:** Maintain a Social Listening System. To listen a ton of comments of social channels (Facebook, Youtube, Instagrams, Twitter, ...), I have to use many techniques, liraries on this system such as

- _Elasticsearch_ to store and query data
- Appy microservice architecture with pattern "Messaging" (instead of using RabbitMQ, I used _Redis_ as broker delivery)
- Use _GraphQL_ on front of services
- Deploy microservices by _Docker_ containers
- Using CI tools on git services (bitbucket, gitlab) to improve development process

The best thing I did is upgrade the old system (NodeJS v0.12) to new structure I described above. To upgrade, I followed these steps

- Learned the business logic
- Write unit test and implement it
- Cleanup the unit test and code I wrote
- Repeate these steps over, over and over until no more code to upgrade
- Break the monolithic application to micorservice application
